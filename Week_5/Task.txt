1. Export Data from Database to CSV, Parquet, and Avro File Formats:

   Connect to your database and write queries to select the desired data.

  - To CSV:
    - Utilize the 'Export Data' wizard in SSMS:
        - Right-click the database, navigate to 'Tasks', and select 'Export Data'.
        - Choose your data source (SQL Server).
        - For the destination, select 'Flat File Destination' and configure the path and file format (CSV).
        - Specify the query or tables to export.
        - Export data to a CSV file.

  - To Parquet and Avro:*
    - SQL Server does not natively support exporting to Parquet or Avro formats.

2. Configure Scheduled and Event Triggers to Automate Pipeline Processes:
- We can use SQL Server Agent
  - Open SSMS and expand the 'SQL Server Agent'.
  - Right-click 'Jobs' and select 'New Job'.
  - Provide a name for the job.
  - Under 'Steps', click 'New' and add a step to run your SQL script.
  - Under 'Schedules', click 'New' to create a schedule for the job.
  - Set the frequency and time for the job to run.
  - Save and enable the job.

  *Event Triggers:*
  - Use SQL Server Event Notifications.

3. Copy All Tables from One Database to Another:

  - Use the 'Generate Scripts' wizard:
    - Right-click the source database, navigate to 'Tasks', and select 'Generate Scripts'.
    - Select all tables.
    - Choose to save the script to a file or clipboard.
    - Run the generated script on the target database.


4. Copy Selective Tables with Selective Columns from One Database to Another:

    -SQL query
      ```
      INSERT INTO TargetDatabase.dbo.TargetTable (Column1, Column2, ...)
      SELECT Column1, Column2, ...
      FROM SourceDatabase.dbo.SourceTable;
      ```
